    <h2>What do we do?</h2>
    <p>There are limits to what the government is able to achieve. In that sense, we take action to help improve the Amsterdam community through development initiatives.</p>
    <p>We believe that positive change starts with the individual social responsibility (ISR). We think critically about the greatest challenges faced by our community, Amsterdam, and take action to be a part of the solution.</p>
