          <h1>The Big Idea</h1>
          <p>
            Imagine what a community could become if young people from different backgrounds work together to find targeted solutions to local issues and address the critical challenges of our time while developing the skills, knowledge and understanding. We're not only talking about charity or service, but also about sustainable impact locally and globally.
            <!--It only takes one active citizen to change the world. Be that active citizen today.-->
            <!--Together, we are working to make a service year a common expectation and common opportunity for all young Americans. This will create the next generation of leaders who think differently about their obligations to one another and their community. This vision of every young person undertaking a service year is the next "big idea" and Americans everywhere are mobilizing to support it. You can too.-->
          </p>
